# surv

Generated with Phaser Game Creator.

This repo is built to be opened by a coding agent. Common agents should auto-load the root instructions; `AGENTS.md` is the context anchor and operating contract for every prompt.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run agent:audit
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Smoke Tests

If this project includes Playwright smoke tests, install the browser once before running them:

```bash
npx playwright install
npm run test:smoke
```

On Linux CI, use `npx playwright install --with-deps` if the environment is missing browser dependencies.
