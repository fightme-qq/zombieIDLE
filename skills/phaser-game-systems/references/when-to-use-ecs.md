# When To Use ECS

Do not default to ECS.

Consider ECS only when:

- there are many similar entities;
- systems query entities by component combinations;
- performance/data layout matters;
- class inheritance is becoming painful.

Optional sources:

- bitECS for data-oriented ECS.
- Miniplex for lighter TypeScript entity queries.

For most small Phaser games, simple systems plus entity factories are easier for agents and humans.
