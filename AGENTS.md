# Agent Instructions For surv

This repository is a Phaser mobile/desktop game project. Treat Phaser game development as the primary domain.

## Always-On Context

For every user prompt in this repository, treat this `AGENTS.md` file as the always-on context anchor. The user should not need to say "read the docs" or "load the context"; this file, `AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`, and the local skill map define the default operating context.

Use deeper docs only when the current task needs them, but never ignore this project context.

## First Read Order

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `START_HERE.md`
3. `AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`
4. `npm run agent:audit` if dependencies are installed
5. `skills/_meta/task-map.md`
6. The specific `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` for the task
7. Relevant docs for the task, such as `docs/first-playable-contract.md`, `docs/validation-matrix.md`, and `docs/quality-gates.md`
8. Relevant source files under `src/game/`

## Core Rule

Follow `AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` before coding. Use the project-local skills before making architecture, scene, input, layout, UI, asset, gamefeel, or testing changes.

When starting a task, say which skill you are using:

```text
Using phaser-scene-workflow because this changes scene lifecycle and transitions.
```

- Quality gates before calling work done: `docs/quality-gates.md`
- Reusable module starting points: `templates/modules/`

## Project Boundaries

- Keep Phaser runtime code under `src/game/`.
- Keep pure game rules independent from Phaser when practical, so they can be unit-tested.
- Use pointer input as the cross-platform baseline.
- Prioritize touch ergonomics, safe areas, and phone viewport checks.
- Add keyboard shortcuts for desktop ergonomics.
- Keep mobile layout readable and touch targets large enough.
- Do not add backend, multiplayer, React, Electron, Capacitor, or ECS unless the human explicitly asks.
- Keep Yandex Games requirements in mind before any release build: no external CDN, SDK `/sdk.js`, LoadingAPI.ready, GameplayAPI pause/resume, localized text, and Python ZIP packaging.

## Change Workflow

1. Follow `AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`.
2. Identify the task category.
3. Read the matching skill.
4. Check `templates/modules/` if the task needs a common system.
5. Inspect existing files before editing.
6. Make the smallest coherent change.
7. Run the most relevant verification:
   - `npm run build`
   - `npm run dev`
   - `npm run agent:audit`
   - `npm run test:smoke` if Playwright is enabled
8. Update `docs/decisions/` if architecture, scene flow, input strategy, scale mode, assets, publishing, or core rules changed.
9. Report what changed and what was verified.

## Skill Maintenance

Use `skills/_meta/update-skills.md` before editing skills. Skills should stay concise, task-triggered, and Phaser-specific.
