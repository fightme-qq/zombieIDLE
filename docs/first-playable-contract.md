# First Playable Contract

The first playable is done only when the player can understand, act, receive feedback, and try again.

## Required

- Player can perform the core action.
- There is one clear goal.
- There is one obstacle, risk, timer, enemy, puzzle constraint, or failure pressure.
- The game responds with visible feedback.
- The loop has win, lose, restart, or continue behavior.
- The scene works on mobile-first and desktop fallback viewports.
- The code builds with `npm run build`.
- Smoke tests or manual validation confirm canvas visibility and interaction.

## Not Required Yet

- full menu flow;
- many levels;
- final art;
- full economy;
- backend;
- multiplayer;
- deep progression;
- complex editor tooling.

## Replacement Rule

The generated sandbox should be replaced only when the first playable loop exists. Do not replace it with a prettier static screen.

## Definition Of Done

```text
I can start the game, perform the main action, see feedback, hit success/failure pressure, and restart or continue.
```
