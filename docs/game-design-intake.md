# Game Design Intake

Use this file to turn a human's rough idea into a buildable Phaser task.

## Extract These Facts

- Game fantasy: what the player imagines doing.
- Core action: the main verb, such as move, jump, dodge, swap, shoot, collect, choose.
- Camera: fixed, top-down, side-view, board, card/table, scrolling.
- Primary target: mobile-first.
- Input: pointer, touch, keyboard, mouse, gamepad.
- Goal: what success means in the first loop.
- Pressure: timer, enemy, obstacle, limited moves, risk, puzzle constraint.
- Feedback: what should feel good immediately.
- Restart: how the player tries again.

## If Details Are Missing

Infer a small version and continue.

Default assumptions:

- Use Phaser 3 with TypeScript and Vite.
- Keep runtime code under `src/game/`.
- Use pointer input as a shared baseline.
- Add keyboard support for desktop actions.
- Use touch-safe controls for mobile actions.
- Start with generated/code-drawn placeholder art.
- Add real assets only when sources and licenses are known.
